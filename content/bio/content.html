                <h2>History</h2>

                <h4>Getting Started in Engineering</h4>
                <p>
                    After graduating high school, I started working for the company Virticus where I used SolidWorks to design stamped sheet metal boxes to house the lighting control electronics the company was manufacturing. I learned a lot about designing for sheet metal stamping and also how to engage and collaborate with other engineers in order to meet their needs for the product.
                </p>

                <h4>Finding My Stride at Vivint Solar</h4>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2014 I decided to move out to Utah, and after working for a few months at a pizza restaurant, I got a job at Vivint Solar as a CAD technician designing residential rooftop solar systems. Within the first few months I quickly became one of the company's top performers out of 200 designers, and received recognition from the CEO of the company. In this role I learned how to be effective in a fast-paced environment where speed and quality are coupled. 
                </p>

                <h4>Leading a Team and Beta Process</h4>
                <p>
                    With my success in this role, I was soon offered a Team Lead position of a new team in the design department beta testing a new process that would eventually reinvent how the whole company designed our products. This was a tough assignment to take on—I had to both learn how to be a leader, but also take on the challenges of a brand new process that needed a lot of kinks to be worked out. Furthermore, a month after taking on the position, a group of new team members with no design experience were transferred to my team. I was suddenly responsible for the onboarding and teaching of these new members alongside the challenges I was already facing. Thanks to my experience from working at a Boy Scout camp in high school, I found that I had a good grasp of how to teach technically complex skills to the new members of the team. After the success of this beta team, our process was adopted by the entire company and I was set to rejoin the normal workforce as a designer again. 
                </p>

                <h4>Back to School and Working Full-Time</h4>
                <p>
                    However, during my experience as a lead, I realized that I wanted to go get a degree in Mechanical Engineering, so I decided to move to Corvallis, where my brother was living, and go to school at OSU. Before moving, my direct manager at Vivint Solar reached out and said he wanted me to continue working for the company with a remote position. This was not a normal position the company offered and I would be the first in the design department to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In August of 2017 I started school in Corvallis and worked full time from home in my off hours. This carried on for about a year when I was asked by an old friend of mine at Vivint Solar to come work with his new team working directly with home builders to design solar arrays for entire housing developments. This new team promised to make the whole process more efficient as we would be given the architectural plans directly from the builders. I was excited to take on this new challenge, so I decided to take 6 months off from school in order to give the new position my full attention. This delayed my graduation, but I didn't want to give half of my attention to this new position. 
                </p>

                <h4>Navigating COVID and a Company Merger</h4>
                <p>
                    After gaining confidence with the new process, I returned to school and continued working in my off time. I also took some time off from school during COVID—I found that while I could work remotely, I had a hard time taking classes online and actually learning the material effectively. When the COVID lockdowns started I was in Differential Equations class, so I found it important to learn that really well. But after the lockdowns lifted and I could return to school in person, I started back up again. Also around this time, the company Sunrun bought and integrated Vivint Solar, so my New Homes team was rolled into Sunrun's own New Homes team which was much smaller than ours at the time. During the merger, I helped merge the two processes and taught my old team members the new changes.
                </p>

                <h4>Exploring Medical Technology at Lazarus 3D</h4>
                <p>
                    In the fall of 2022 I landed an internship position as a 3D printing technician at a startup, Lazarus 3D. Their mission is to create silicone models of human organs for surgeons to practice surgery on. They would receive CAT scans of the patient that would be undergoing surgery and the team would create a 3D model and 3D print a mold of the relevant tissue. We would then cast the model in silicone for the surgeons to practice their surgery beforehand. This would allow the surgeons to gain an intimate feel for the specific patient, and depending on the situation, we would add in specific details, like veins or cartilage out of TPU or anything the situation required and embedded those details into the silicone mold. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this position I operated and maintained a print farm of over 30 Ultimaker S5 printers. This involved everything from cleaning and fixing to setting them up and making sure they had clean consistent power through UPSs. I also took on some other projects during my time in the internship which included shop reorganization, process and SOP design, and tool design. Specifically here, I'll talk about the tool I designed, which was a measuring pump for the silicone material. We bought our silicone material in 5 gallon buckets that needed 2 parts to be mixed in specific ratios. I was tasked with sourcing a pump for this but could not find anything that would work with the extremely viscous silicone for any sort of reasonable price. So I designed a pump based around what is called a progressive cavity pump, which excelled at pumping chunky and high viscosity fluids. I then combined this with stepper motors and strain gauges to weigh the fluid to measure and pump the silicone in the correct ratios. My internship ended after 4 months, and I left on good terms but didn't want to continue working with the company.
                </p>

                <h4>Building Tools and Graduating</h4>
                <p>
                    I continued at my job at Sunrun throughout my intership, but after it was over there was a shake up in my teams leadership and I started to take on more responsibility. I began building internal tools for the team to use, focusing mostly on QA tools and writing SOPs. I continued working full time and going to school until this last spring when I graduated! I've continued working at Sunrun as a Tools designer and writing SOP's since.
