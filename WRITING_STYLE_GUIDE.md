# Mitchell Van Wagoner - Writing Style Guide

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Professional but conversational** - Technical content presented accessibly without being dumbed down
- **Matter-of-fact** - Achievements and capabilities stated directly without hype or overselling
- **Honest and practical** - Acknowledges challenges, limitations, and things that didn't work perfectly
- **Solution-oriented** - Focus on solving real problems with practical constraints

### Perspective
- **First person for individual projects** - "I designed," "I built," "I discovered"
- **First person plural for teams** - "Our team," "We developed," "We faced"
- **Active voice preferred** - Direct subject-verb-object construction
- **Personal storytelling** - Uses narrative structure with chronological flow

## Structural Patterns

### Opening Paragraphs
- Lead with the practical problem or project goal
- State what makes the project unique or interesting
- Provide context about constraints or requirements
- Example: "What makes this project unique is that instead of using a traditional counter weight-on-arm design, I built a pulley mechanism..."

### Body Content
- **Problem → Solution → Results** structure
- Clear chronological progression when telling project stories
- Technical depth with context for non-experts
- Specific details: numbers, measurements, tools, timelines
- Real-world constraints mentioned naturally (transportability, budget, time)

### Transitions
- "However" for challenges or pivots
- "After," "Then," "This led to" for chronological flow
- "To fix this," "To accomplish this" for solutions
- "What sets this apart" for differentiation

## Language Characteristics

### Technical Writing
- Uses specific technical terminology appropriately without over-explaining
- Explains complex concepts through context rather than definitions
- Integrates technical details into narrative flow
- Example: "Using the Euler-Lagrange method to derive the equations of motion for the system"

### Specificity
- Concrete details over vague statements
- Numbers and measurements when relevant ("20 meters," "4.3 seconds," "30-hour print")
- Named tools and technologies ("DeepFace," "Llama 3.2-1b," "PETG")
- Specific job titles and company names in work history

### Honesty About Challenges
- Directly states what didn't work or what was difficult
- "This turned out to be not quite correct, but it still led to a good enough simulation"
- "I'll be redesigning this part from scratch for version two"
- "The main challenge arose from the limitations of..."
- Describes how problems were discovered and solved

### Avoiding Generic AI Patterns
- **NO excessive enthusiasm** - Avoid words like "incredibly," "amazing," "revolutionary," "game-changing"
- **NO marketing speak** - Avoid corporate buzzwords and sales language
- **NO overuse of adjectives** - Let the work speak for itself
- **NO passive voice dumps** - Keep the active, personal voice
- **NO vague claims** - Always back up statements with specifics

## Sentence Structure

### Sentence Length
- Mix of short and medium sentences
- Longer sentences for technical explanations with proper punctuation
- Short sentences for impact or clarity
- Example: "This was a pain, but ultimately won't be much of an issue as the cable that wraps around the pulley will pull the two pieces together. There's little chance the bond will break."

### Paragraph Flow
- Topic sentence establishing the point
- Supporting details with specifics
- Transition to next logical step or topic
- Generally 2-4 sentences per paragraph in technical writing

## Describing Work

### Achievements
- State accomplishments directly without embellishment
- Focus on what was built and what it does
- Include measurable outcomes when possible
- Example: "Within the first few months I quickly became one of the company's top performers out of 200 designers"

### Challenges & Solutions Format
- **Challenge:** Brief statement of the problem
- **Solution:** Detailed explanation of approach and implementation
- Focus on the engineering/problem-solving process
- Acknowledge when solutions are partial or iterative

### Process Description
- Step-by-step when appropriate
- Explains reasoning behind decisions
- Mentions alternative approaches considered
- Describes iterations and refinements
- Example: "I chose to throw the projectile, in this case an apple, 20 meters using only the weight of a 5-gallon bucket filled with water. Using a bucket meant I could easily transport the system and precisely control the weight..."

## Personal Storytelling

### Work History Narratives
- Chronological progression with clear transitions
- Personal context and motivations included
- Honest about career decisions and challenges
- Specific anecdotes that illustrate experiences
- Example: "This was a tough assignment to take on—I had to both learn how to be a leader, but also take on the challenges of a brand new process that needed a lot of kinks to be worked out."

### Project Narratives
- Design process with reasoning
- Fabrication steps with specific details
- Testing and real-world results
- Lessons learned and future improvements

## Key Phrases and Patterns

### Common Openings
- "To [accomplish goal], I [took action]..."
- "What makes this [unique/interesting] is..."
- "The [system/project] was designed to..."
- "After [event], I [action]..."

### Describing Features
- "This feature was crucial in achieving..."
- "What sets this system apart is..."
- "The key insight here is..."
- "One of the reasons why I wanted to..."

### Acknowledging Limitations
- "This turned out to be..."
- "However, [problem] arose..."
- "I'll be redesigning this..."
- "Future improvements could include..."

### Results and Impact
- "This resulted in..."
- "The system performed successfully..."
- "By transforming [old way] into [new way]..."
- "This has created a culture of..."

## Project Documentation Structure

### Overview Section
1. Hook: What makes it interesting/unique
2. Technical approach summary
3. Key constraints or requirements
4. Technologies/methods used
5. Main outcomes

### Technical Report Section
1. Background/motivation
2. Design process with alternatives considered
3. Implementation details
4. Testing and results
5. Challenges faced and solutions
6. Future work or improvements

## Examples of Voice

### Good (Authentic Mitchell)
- "I discovered a sign error that was causing the total energy in my system to grow instead of decay."
- "The power cut out during the 30-hour print, and at the time I didn't have my printer on a UPS, so I had to reprint the top part and glue them together with CA glue."
- "Previously, our team relied on simple checklists with no feedback mechanism, resulting in inconsistent QA reports."

### Avoid (Generic AI)
- "I'm incredibly passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive innovation."
- "This groundbreaking solution revolutionized our workflow and exceeded all expectations."
- "Through my extensive experience, I've mastered the art of seamlessly integrating complex systems."

## Tone Calibration

### Professional Context (Resume, Bio, Portfolio)
- Confident but not boastful
- Focused on capabilities and accomplishments
- Includes career progression narrative
- Acknowledges learning experiences

### Technical Context (Project Reports)
- Detailed and specific
- Includes methodology and reasoning
- Honest about challenges and limitations
- Educational without being condescending

### Personal Context (Project Narratives)
- Enthusiastic but measured
- Shares the problem-solving journey
- Includes mistakes and iterations
- Practical insights and lessons learned

## Final Guidelines

1. **Write like explaining to a colleague** - Someone with technical background but not necessarily your specialty
2. **Show don't tell** - Use specific examples rather than claiming expertise
3. **Embrace imperfection** - Real projects have challenges, mention them
4. **Be specific** - Names, numbers, tools, timelines
5. **Focus on the work** - Let achievements speak through description of what was built
6. **Use natural transitions** - Chronological or logical flow without forced connections
7. **Keep it practical** - Real-world constraints and applications matter
8. **Maintain authenticity** - Personal voice over polished marketing speak
