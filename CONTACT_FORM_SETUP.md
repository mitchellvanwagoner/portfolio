# Contact Form Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Your contact form is now ready to work! 

The form has been implemented with multiple submission methods for maximum reliability.

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Options

### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Free & Easy)

1. **Sign up for Formspree**: Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a free account
2. **Create a new form** in your Formspree dashboard
3. **Copy your Form ID** (looks like `xvojpkmq` or similar)
4. **Update the form action** in `content/contact/content.html` line 199:
   ```html
   <!-- Change this line: -->
   <form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   
   <!-- To this (replace YOUR_FORM_ID with your actual ID): -->
   <form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/xvojpkmq" method="POST">
   ```

**That's it!** Your form will now send emails directly to your inbox.

### Option 2: Netlify Forms (If hosting on Netlify)

1. **Add netlify attribute** to the form tag:
   ```html
   <form id="contact-form" netlify name="contact" method="POST">
   ```
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - Forms automatically work with no additional setup!

### Option 3: Keep as Mailto Fallback (No setup required)

If you don't set up Formspree or Netlify, the form will automatically fallback to opening the user's email client with a pre-filled message.
